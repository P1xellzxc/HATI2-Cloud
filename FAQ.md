# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is HATI² Cloud?
HATI² Cloud is a personal finance tool designed for people who value privacy and aesthetics. It helps you organize expenses into isolated "collections" (Folders) rather than putting everything in one big bucket.

## What does "HATI-HATI" mean?
"Hati-hati" means "Be Careful" or "Take Care" in Indonesian/Malay. It reflects our philosophy: **Take care of your wealth.**

## Is this a PWA?
Yes! You can install HATI² Cloud on your phone:
- **iOS**: Tap "Share" -> "Add to Home Screen".
- **Android**: Tap the menu (three dots) -> "Install App".

## How safe is my data?
Your data is stored in a secure Supabase (PostgreSQL) database protected by Row Level Security (RLS).
- **Only YOU** can see your private folders.
- **Only Members** can see shared folders.
- We do not sell or analyze your financial data.

## Why "Invite Only"?
We prioritize quality and privacy. Currently, you can only join if you are invited to a folder or have a direct invite link (Coming Soon in v1.2).

## Can I change my currency?
Yes! Each folder can have its own currency (PHP, USD, JPY, etc.). This is perfect for travel collections.
